-git becomes aware that the directory is a repository.  You need it so that git knows where the repository is

-q8 This is honestly one of the concepts that I do not yet understand.. git can tell the difference, if I want to constantly not include a file or a type or set of files I can put them in git ignore..  And typing this I just realized, it allows you to manually decide on your commit, which has been a theme here.

-you only add the files belonging to a logical change to the staging area before committing

-bug fix paths
-new development items
-experimental tests

-it help to see the commit history and what commits are and are not in master or any other branch

-the changes from both branches are combined.
-the commits are coming together to form one commit

- auto saves a lot of work with code that does not have conflics
